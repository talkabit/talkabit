	<p>Education has always been a hot discussion topic. Recently there’s a lot of fuss on how can we disrupt education; don’t sit down because it’s happening now! 
This talk will focus on Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC), starting from their origins, their depth when compared with traditional learning tools (schools), and why we think they will change education and life-long learning.
Our personal goal is to encourage the audience to embrace MOOC and try them as soon as they find a computer available.

	<p>The role of a tester is to identify what is wrong, analyse the impact and flag that issue to be fixed. Is that it?
<br>Luís will share his findings about the challenges a software tester faces on very different companies such as a startup (Mobicomp), a multinational software corporation (Microsoft) and an independent software testing agency (Maincheck).

	<p>Nowadays, our education system is based on a step-by-step evolution that poses our society with a very slow grade of adaptability. Our proposal is to present a complete new way of teach our students, based on the logic envolved in every strategy game from success points achieved on every single goal to a healthy competition among them based on scores instead of simple grades. In this system, we could have a much greater success of our education system at the same time we keep evolving into a new ways of thinking. 
The goal here is to achieve a high level of adaptation to society evolution and needs at the same time we grant them access to new skills to aproach their own success.

	<p>Everyday we are offered a load of attractive free services and products, from social networks to free software and games. But behind those services there is always a trade-off: How is your privacy being handled by service providers? What kind of sensitive information are “you” making available for third parties? Can you really guarantee that any of your personal information is never published on the Internet?
In this talk we are going to answer these questions by analyzing the privacy policies of the most used services nowadays.

developments raise much concern nowadays. Citizens’ rights are being violated every day, so it’s time
to rethink how we can better use technology in benefit of individuals while protecting them from abuse.
Privacy by Design is a key concept to this purpose. If technology raises the problem it can also provide the
solution. First be aware, then be creative!

		Bullet and the Shield: Freedom and Censorship Competition in the Digital Era
	</h3>
	
		<span class="tag">Censorship</span>
	
		<span class="tag">Digital freedom</span>
	
	
	<p>The decentralized nature of the Internet created unique conditions for humans
to exchange information, create knowledge, develop in the most unusual ways.
Great amplifier of culture, the Internet created an absolutely new environment
for the key fields of people's political and social activity: new dimensions of
freedom of speech, freedom of assembly (a virtual assembly), creation of
communities, etc. Yet, as powerful as are the new possibilities of the
disruptive technology to change our way of life, the more powerful are the
possibilities of those actors that reject change, authoritarian governments
being the most influential. Post-Soviet space exemplifies this complex
rivalry of pro-change and contra-change processes.
Who will win? Will the Web change Humanity or the humans will successfully
limit, fragmentize and finally destroy it?
